For code to work, you will need to run npm install and create a .env file in your root directory with:
REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:8000/callback'
CLIENT_SECRET = ''
CLIENT_ID = ''
ACCESS_TOKEN = ''
REFRESH_TOKEN = ''
USER_ID = null

You will need to fill your CLIENT SECRET and CLIENT ID with what is provided when you create an app on the spotify developer dashboard.
REDIRECT_URI can be however you set it.
